Deciphering Decisions: Exploring Market Dynamics and Investor Behavior

This project dives into how people make financial decisions ‚Äî blending traditional market modeling with behavioral finance and game theory. It‚Äôs an attempt to go beyond numbers and understand why markets move the way they do, and how investors react to uncertainty.


üîç What this project covers:

Volatility & Shock Propagation:

Used GARCH and VAR models to study how volatility spreads across different stocks, and identified the most influential stocks using network centrality measures.

Market Complexity through Multifractal Analysis:

Applied multifractal analysis (MF-DFA) to Indian stock indices to measure complexity and long-term memory in price movements ‚Äî and compared them with mature markets like the S&P 500.

Behavioral Biases & Strategy Design:

Looked at how human biases affect trading decisions. Then, built fuzzy logic‚Äìbased rule systems that simulate trader behavior and evolve using a game-theoretic setup.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
Python (NumPy, Pandas, yFinance, arch, matplotlib)

Custom code for GARCH, VAR, MF-DFA, and fuzzy logic rule simulation
